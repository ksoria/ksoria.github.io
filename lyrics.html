<h1> Mad World </h1>

<p>All Around me are fammiliar faces,</p>
<p>Worn out places, worn out faces </p>
<p>Bright and early for the daily races </p>
<p>Going nowhere </p> 
<p>Going nowhere </p>

<p>Their tears are filling up their glasses
<p>No expression 
<p>No expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
 
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you,
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world
Mad World

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday 
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen 
Sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me 
No one knew me
Hello teacher tell me, what's my lesson?
Look right through me 
Look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you,
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world 
Mad world 
Enlargen your world 
Mad world
