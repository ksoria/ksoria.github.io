<h1 id="mattrex"> Mad World </h1>

<p>All Around me are fammiliar faces,</p>
<p>Worn out places, worn out faces </p>
<p>Bright and early for the daily races </p>
<p>Going nowhere </p> 
<p>Going nowhere </p>

<p>Their tears are filling up their glasses</p>
<p>No expression </p>
<p>No expression</p>
<p>Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow</p>
<p>No tomorrow, no tomorrow</p>
 
<p>And I find it kind of funny</p>
<p>I find it kind of sad</p>
<p>The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had</p>
<p>I find it hard to tell you,</p>
<p>I find it hard to take</p>
<p>When people run in circles it's a very, very</p>
<p>Mad world</p>
<p>Mad World</p>

<p>Children waiting for the day they feel good</p>
<p>Happy birthday </p>
<p>Happy birthday</p>
<p>Made to feel the way that every child should</p>
<p>Sit and listen </p>
<p>Sit and listen</p>

<p>Went to school and I was very nervous</p>
<p>No one knew me </p>
<p>No one knew me</p>
<p>Hello teacher tell me, what's my lesson?</p>
<p>Look right through me </p>
<p>Look right through me</p>

<p>And I find it kind of funny</p>
<p>I find it kind of sad</p>
<p>The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had</p>
<p>I find it hard to tell you,</p>
<p>I find it hard to take</p>
<p>When people run in circles it's a very, very</p>
<p>Mad world </p>
<p>Mad world </p>
<p>Enlargen your world </p>
<p>Mad world</p>
