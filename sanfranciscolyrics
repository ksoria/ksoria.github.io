<p>If you're going to San Francisco
<p>Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
<p>If you're going to San Francisco
<p>You're gonna meet some gentle people there

<p>For those who come to San Francisco
<p>Summertime will be a love-in there
<p>In the streets of San Francisco
<p>Gentle people with flowers in their hair

All across the nation such a strange vibration
People in motion
There's a whole generation with a new explanation
People in motion people in motion

For those who come to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there

If you come to San Francisco
Summertime will be a love-in there
